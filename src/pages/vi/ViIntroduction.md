# Introduction:

Somebody told me that the best way to learn is to explain the concept to others. Therefore, I created this blog primarily to teach myself and hope that you find the blog useful. Covered topics are data science (both from theoretical view and practical use), my notes about Mathematics and sharing my experience

# About me:
I'm currently a PhD student in Mathematics at University of Southern California. My interest includes data science, statistics and Financial Math.

# Introduction:

Somebody told me that the best way to learn is to explain the concept to others. Therefore, I created this blog primarily to teach myself and hope that you find the blog useful. Covered topics are data science <span class="tex2jax_ignore">(</span>both from theoretical view and practical use<span class="tex2jax_ignore">)</span>, my notes about Mathematics and sharing my experience.
